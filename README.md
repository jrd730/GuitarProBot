GuitarProBot
============

GuitarProBot is a really simple command line tool for printing guitar tablature into the GuitarPro program. It does this in what is probably the most ridiculous way possible by performing virtual key presses to input the notes one at a time. I know what your thinking: "That's fucking stupid! Why don't you just write music using GuitarPro's native format?" Well, GuitarPro's file format is proprietary and not something I can easily reverse engineer. Additionally the format is likely to change with each version of GuitarPro whereas the hotkeys for inputting notes pretty much stay the same. The current version of GuitarProBot is an experimental proof of concept and will probably change a lot if I decide to keep working on it.
